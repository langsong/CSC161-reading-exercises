Question 1:

int is an integer reflecting the natural size of integers on the host
machine;
float is a number with single-precision floating point;
double is a number with double-precision floating point;
short is a qualifier that could be applied to numbers, and it provides
normally 16 bit length.

Question 2:
3.0
Because all numbers in the expression are interger type. The type of the
result of y is also an integer, so it's 3. Then the result becomes 3.0
after applying float onto it.

Question 3:
i is 1, j is 1, x is 0, and y is 1
i++ increments i after setting x to 0, and ++j increments j before
assigning y the value of j.
